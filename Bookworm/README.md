## üß© Code Highlights

### Custom Rating Component

The app features a custom `CustomRatingView`, allowing users to easily rate books with a star-based UI.

```swift
struct CustomRatingView: View {
    @Binding var rating: Int
    var maximumRating = 5
    var offImage: Image?
    var onImage = Image(systemName: "star.fill")
    var offColor = Color.gray
    var onColor = Color.yellow
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(1..<maximumRating + 1, id: \.self) { number in
                image(for: number)
                    .foregroundColor(number > rating ? offColor : onColor)
                    .onTapGesture {
                        rating = number
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Emoji Rating View

A fun `EmojiRatingView` component displays emojis based on the user‚Äôs rating, adding a playful element to the app.

### SwiftData Persistence

The app leverages SwiftData for efficient storage and retrieval, ensuring all book data persists across sessions.

```swift
@Model
class Book {
    var title: String
    var author: String
    var genre: String
    var review: String
    var rating: Int
    var timeStamp: Date
}
```

### Data Validation

Form validation ensures users input meaningful data, with empty fields or whitespace-only strings deemed invalid.
