## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players tap on the flag they think is correct.
- **Score Tracking**: The app keeps track of the player's score, displaying it in real-time and in alerts.
- **Progress Tracking**: The game runs for 8 questions, and the progress is tracked visually using a ProgressView.
- **Dynamic UI**: The app uses SwiftUI's dynamic view building, with components like VStack, ZStack, and HStack to create a responsive and adaptive UI.
- **Alerts**: Informative alerts are shown to the player when they guess correctly or incorrectly, with feedback on their choice.



### What I Learned

- `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`: For arranging views vertically, horizontally, and in layers, respectively.
- `Button`: For interactive elements that respond to user taps.
- `Alert`: To show messages to the user.
- `ProgressView`: To display the progress of the game visually.
- `LinearGradient`: Used in ProgressView to enhance the UI with gradient colors.
