# Rock Paper Scissors - Brain Training Game

## Project Overview

This is a simple yet fun brain training game built using SwiftUI. The game challenges players to win or lose at Rock, Paper, Scissors based on the app's prompts. Each turn, the app randomly picks either Rock, Paper, or Scissors and asks the player to either win or lose against the chosen move. The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game. The game continues for 10 rounds, after which the player's score is displayed.

## Components Used

- **Views:**
  - `VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`: Used for arranging the UI components vertically, horizontally, and for background layering.
  - `Text`: Used for displaying static text and dynamic information like score, round number, and game instructions.
  - `Button`: Used for interactive elements that allow the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
  - `Image`: Displays system images representing Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
  - `Alert`: Provides feedback to the player at the end of the game with the final score.

- **State Management:**
  - `@State`: Used to manage the state of the game, including the app's move, whether the player should win or lose, the player's score, and the current round number.

- **Styling and Layout:**
  - `LinearGradient`: Used to create a visually appealing background for the game.
  - `ForegroundColor`: Applied to text and images for consistent color styling.
  - `Padding`, `Frame`, and `ClipShape`: Used to style the buttons and other UI elements for better user experience.

## What I Learned

1. **State Management:**
   - How to use `@State` properties to manage dynamic data in a SwiftUI view.
   - Updating the UI reactively based on state changes.

2. **UI Design with SwiftUI:**
   - Using stacks (`VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack`) to arrange UI elements.
   - Applying gradients and other styling techniques to create a visually appealing interface.
   - Creating custom buttons and integrating system images to represent game moves.

3. **Conditional Logic:**
   - Implementing game logic using conditional statements to determine if the player should win or lose.
   - Handling user interactions and updating the state based on the player's choices.

4. **Alerts:**
   - Displaying alerts to provide feedback to the player, including the final score after 10 rounds.
   - Using alerts to restart the game by resetting the state.

5. **SwiftUI Animations and Effects:**
   - Applying animations and visual effects, such as shadows, to enhance the user experience.

## How to Play

1. The app will randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The app will instruct you to either "WIN" or "LOSE."
3. Choose the correct move that corresponds to the instruction:
   - If the app shows "Rock" and "WIN," you should select "Paper."
   - If the app shows "Rock" and "LOSE," you should select "Scissors."
4. The game continues for 10 rounds, after which your final score will be displayed.
5. You can then choose to play again and try to improve your score!
